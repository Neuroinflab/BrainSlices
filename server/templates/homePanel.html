<h2>A story of the Epic Research</h2>
<p>
 The research was over.<br>
 Researcher the Librarian stared at dead corpses of slaughtered mice. Their brains removed and sliced, the slices stained and investigated with a microscope.<br>
 Researcher was sad. He grasped his precious specimens and asked himself if all his deeds for their preparation were in vain. The research is over, the paper published. No one will appreciate his treasures... Their destiny is to fall into an oblivion.<br>
 - Shall more innocent lives be taken just to make somebody see what I saw? - he asked loudly, then raised hand to throw the specimens away.<br>
 - Wait a moment! - he heard a strong voice. A wiseman was approaching him. - Do not waste results of your research. There is a portal, which wise Researchers use to memorize their specimen for future generations. Its name is BrainSlices.

<h2>A bit less epic description of the service</h2>
<p>
 The BrainSlices service is an online repository of high-resolution images of brain tissue with detailed description.<br>
 With BrainSlices you can share your images with collaborators all around the globe as well as you can refer to them (images, not collaborators) in your papers.<br>
</p>

<h3>Browse specimens in the repository</h3>
<p>
 The service gives you an opportunity to view specimens obtained by researcher all arround the world, possibly <b>saving your time, money and sparing lives of animals</b> (e.g. if a pilot study you planned to launch has been already done by someone else).<br>
 Our service allows you to view (in online mode) even huge images without a loss in a performance.
